For the purpose of this tutorial, the hypothetical datasheet is constructed based on the textbook by @rohan and journal article by @gebru2021datasheets, using open source statistically programming language R [@citeR]. The dataset includes systolic blood pressure and other health factor, and is provided by University of Toronto Scarborough course called STAC67 Regression Analysis. I got to obtain and analyze the dataset which is based on the medical scientific journal by @SBP_2021 for my last degree [^1].
